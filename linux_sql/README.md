# Introdution
This project explores how we can monitor servers/nodes running in a cluster, allows them to communicate through switches.
These nodes running CentOS 7 communicate through the switching of ethernet packets. We can use the bash shell
to collect hardware and resource usage information among nodes on the same network. This information will be made available
to use for the Jarvis LCA team. The technologies used include git, docker, postgresql, and bash.

# Quickstart
Pull postgres docker image with the command and create a volume. 
```
docker pull postres

```
